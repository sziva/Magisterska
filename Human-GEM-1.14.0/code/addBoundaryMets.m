function new_model = addBoundaryMets(model, exch_only)
%addBoundaryMets  Add boundary metabolites to a model structure.
%
%   Boundary metabolites are pseudometabolites that exist at the system
%   boundary, and are used for the import/export of mass into/out of the
%   system. 
%   For example: "glc[extracellular] <==> glc[boundary]"
%
%   Some models do not use boundary metabolites, but instead formulate
%   these exchange reactions (or "demand/DM" or "sink" reactions) without
%   an explicit product (or reactant).
%   For example: "glc[extracellular] <==> "
%
%   This function identifies all reactions that involve the conversion of 
%   a single metabolite into nothing (or vice versa), and balances the
%   reaction with the same metabolite in a different (boundary) comparment.
%   The function will also add any new boundary metabolites to the model if
%   they did not yet exist.
%
% USAGE:
%
%   new_model = addBoundaryMets(model, exch_only);
%
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   model       Model structure.
%
%   exch_only   (Optional, default = FALSE) 
%               If TRUE, only exchange rxns (i.e., into/out of the
%               extracellular compartment) will be considered.
%               If FALSE, reactions involving mets in other compartments
%               will also be considered. For example:
%
%               "met[nucleus] -->" becomes "met[nucleus] --> met[boundary]"
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%   new_model   New model structure, with added boundary metabolites.
